    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    For many years, i-vector based audio embedding techniques were the
    dominant approach for speaker verification and speaker diarization
    applications. However, mirroring the rise of deep learning in various
    domains, neural network based audio embeddings, also known as d-vectors,
    have consistently demonstrated superior speaker verification performance.
    In this paper, we build on the success of d-vector based speaker
    verification systems to develop a new d-vector based approach to speaker
    diarization. Specifically, we combine LSTM-based d-vector audio embeddings
    with recent work in non-parametric clustering to obtain a state-of-the-art
    speaker diarization system. Our system is evaluated on three standard
    public datasets, suggesting that d-vector based diarization systems offer
    significant advantages over traditional i-vector based systems. We
    achieved a 12.0% diarization error rate on NIST SRE 2000 CALLHOME, while
    our model is trained with out-of-domain data from voice search logs.
