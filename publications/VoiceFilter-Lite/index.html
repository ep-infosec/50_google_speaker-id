    <p><b>Abstract:</b>
      We introduce VoiceFilter-Lite, a single-channel source separation model that runs on the device to preserve only
      the speech signals from a target user, as part of a streaming speech recognition system. Delivering such a model
      presents numerous challenges: It should improve the performance when the input signal consists of overlapped
      speech, and must not hurt the speech recognition performance under all other acoustic conditions. Besides, this
      model must be tiny, fast, and perform inference in a streaming fashion, in order to have minimal impact on CPU,
      memory, battery and latency. We propose novel techniques to meet these multi-faceted requirements, including
      using
      a new asymmetric loss, and adopting adaptive runtime suppression strength. We also show that such a model can be
      quantized as a 8-bit integer model and run in realtime.
